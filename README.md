# code-refractor

## Description

This project is an assigment I have for the beginning unit of the Bootcamp.
My main motivation for this project was to apply the knowledge I have learned regarding HTML and and CSS.
The reason why I completed this assignment was to showcase my skills and the level of understanding I have for HTML and CSS.
I learned how to identify and use proper HTML tags and CSS properties to create clean documentation for the webpage.
